**Zaplanuj Jedzonko**- the three-person team project created during ScrumLab workshops. Web app for planning meals for the following days and weeks. CRUD for users, meals, and plans. Registration and login functionality. We built the project using Maven based on two design patterns: DAO and MVC. The data are loaded from a MySQL database with JDBC. We used Java EE (servlets, JSP) and put the app on Tomcat. We hashed users' passwords with JBCrypt. We were working according to Scrum and Agile methodologies using Trello to coordinate the project. I was responsible for git workflow.

# ScrumLab

## What is the ScrumLab?

ScrumLab is a project that aims to teach how to work in a team of developers.  It simulates real tasks in a web application project. During this week you will participate in daily meetings, solve problems, do *code reviews* and integrate your code with your peers' code.

ScrumLab will be run differently than other classes at CodersLab. The instructor's participation should be as minimal as possible, ideally he should come only to check the progress - in this class we polish the skills of sharing knowledge between participants and working on the code together at the same time.
Additionally, working with the repository is supposed to resemble a real project - that is why it will be different from the work done during the classes.
